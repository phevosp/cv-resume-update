# I use a global gitignore for most tex files, but for simplicity, I have
# copied the most important files here. My global gitingore is based off the
# following: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/f26f4b12b986085c5dcf4f49a5b0beabdebb4c57/TeX.gitignore

# Core latex/pdflatex auxiliary files:
*.aux
*.lof
*.log
*.lot
*.fls
*.out
*.toc
*.fmt
*.fot
*.cb
*.cb2
.*.lb

# Intermediate documents:
*.dvi
*.xdv
*-converted-to.*

# Generated if empty string is given at "Please type another file name for output:"
.pdf
